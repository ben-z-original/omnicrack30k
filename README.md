# OmniCrack30k
*OmniCrack30k* is a compilation of datasets for structural crack segmentation. The best performing model is provided in this repo, kindly also checkout the corresponding huggingface demo:

It only runs on CPU, so for large images it takes longer. The images above from the BCL dataset are 256Ã—256 and took about 2 seconds.

## Run Model

```
git clone https://github.com/ben-z-original/omnicrack30k
conda create -name py310 python=3.10
conda activate py310
cd omnicrack30k
pip install -e .
```
The plan, i.e. the trained parameters, will be automatically downloaded when one of the commands below is run, but can also be accessed via:

### Start Local Gradio App
The following command starts a local gradio app, which can be opened in the web browser, e.g., at http://127.0.0.1:7860. The infos and warnings concerning nnU-Net can be ignored.
```
python -m omnicrack30k.inference
```
### Single Image
If you provide a path to a folder it also runs on the files in the folder.
```
python -m omnicrack30k.inference assets/UAV75_DSC00573.png
```
