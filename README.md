# OmniCrack30k
*Large benchmarking datasets, such as ImageNet, COCO, Cityscapes, or ScanNet, have enormously promoted research in computer vision. For the domain of crack segmentation, no such large and well-maintained benchmark exists. Crack segmentation is characterized by the decentralized creation of datasets, almost all of which have their specific right to existence. Each dataset covers a different aspect of the surprisingly complex landscape of materials, acquisition conditions, and appearances linked to crack segmentation. The OmniCrack30k dataset forms the first large-scale, systematic, and thorough approach to provide a sustainable basis for tracking methodical progress in the field of crack segmentation. It contains 30k samples from over 20 datasets summing up to 9 billion pixels in total. Featuring materials as diverse as asphalt, ceramic, concrete, masonry, and steel, it paves the road towards universal crack segmentation, a currently under-explored topic. Experiments indicate the effectiveness of transfer learning for crack segmentation: nnU-Net achieves a mean clIoU<sub>4px</sub> of 64% outperforming all other approaches by at least 10% points.*
